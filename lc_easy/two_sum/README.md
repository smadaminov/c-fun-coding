https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target.  You may assume that each input would
have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  You can
return the answer in any order.

To compile the code:

```
gcc main-n2.c -o n2.out
gcc main-n.c -o n.out
```

GOAL is to have an optimized verison of each problem that is faster than 99%
submitted solutions on LeetCode.

As a fun thing, have another solution that uses less memory than 99% of
submitted solutions. This one may have worse complexity compared to the fast
solution.
